/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 17.0      BUILD 17.0      UP20151214       09:59:25

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.594   TIME= 09:59:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.625   TIME= 09:59:25
 Material number 31 (used by element 6402 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.328   TIME= 09:59:26
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.3 is defined in the model.  Switch to    
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.328   TIME= 09:59:26
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.328   TIME= 09:59:26
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 24057).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.297   TIME= 09:59:26
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.500   TIME= 09:59:27
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      88.938   TIME= 10:02:03
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 81%.       
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
