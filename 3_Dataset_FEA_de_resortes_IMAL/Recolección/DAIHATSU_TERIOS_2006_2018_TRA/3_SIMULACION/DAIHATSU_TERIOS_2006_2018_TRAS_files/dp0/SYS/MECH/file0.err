 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.438   TIME= 08:19:29
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.453   TIME= 08:19:29
 Material number 30 (used by element 1974 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.531   TIME= 08:19:30
 Node 1318 connects both contact element 9430 and target element 9678.   
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 08:19:30
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.3 is defined in the model.  Switch to    
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 08:19:30
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.578   TIME= 08:19:30
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 11546).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.891   TIME= 08:19:30
 Node 1318 connects both contact element 9430 and target element 9678.   
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.703   TIME= 08:19:31
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.750   TIME= 08:19:31
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     184.125   TIME= 08:28:37
 Contact element 3520 (real ID 8) status changes abruptly from           
 no-contact -> contact (with target element 4605).                       

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =     185.031   TIME= 08:28:39
 Element 971 (type = 3, SOLID186) (and maybe other elements) has become  
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.If this message appears in the first       
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     216.891   TIME= 08:30:07
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 197%.      
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
